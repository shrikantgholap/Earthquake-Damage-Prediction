# Earthquake-Damage-Prediction 

This repository contains the project *PRCP-1015: Earthquake Damage Prediction*, which aims to predict the level of damage caused by an earthquake using machine learning techniques. The project includes comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building steps — all implemented in the provided Jupyter Notebook.

## 📘 Overview

Earthquakes can lead to severe infrastructure damage, and assessing the extent of this damage quickly is crucial for effective disaster response.  
This project builds a predictive model that classifies buildings into *different damage levels* based on structural and geographic features.

## 🧠 Project Workflow

1. *Data Preprocessing*  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Encode categorical features  
   - Normalize and scale numerical data  

2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*  
   - Analyze distributions and correlations  
   - Visualize key trends affecting building damage  

3. *Model Building*  
   - Train and test multiple models such as:  
     - Random Forest  
     - Decision Tree  
     - XGBoost  
   - Evaluate models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  

4. *Model Evaluation and Comparison*  
   - Identify the best-performing model  
   - Visualize confusion matrix and feature importance

## 📊 Results

The final model demonstrates strong predictive performance in estimating building damage levels, helping prioritize post-earthquake assessments and disaster management strategies.
